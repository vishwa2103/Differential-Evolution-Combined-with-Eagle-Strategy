# Differential-Evolution-Combined-with-Eagle-Strategy

Resource usage is a critical issue in cloud computing, as it directly influences the functionality, cost, and energy efficiency of cloud services. To ensure optimal performance and utilization of cloud resources, effective resource allocation and management are essential, covering aspects such as computing power, storage, and network bandwidth. However, achieving efficient resource utilization is challenging due to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of workloads, the complex and distributed architecture of cloud environments, and the diversity of cloud applications and services.

To address these challenges, various strategies can be employed, such as dynamic resource provisioning, virtual machine consolidation, energy-aware resource allocation, and workload prediction. Our objective is to improve load balancing alongside resource utilization, which can be achieved using natural phenomena or bio-inspired algorithms. One such approach is the ES-DE Algorithm, a two-stage search mechanism that excels in optimization problems by helping to identify optimal placements for balancing workloads while maximizing resource utilization.

The code we provided randomly generates arrays representing physical machines with specific configurations, which are evaluated when assigning physical machines to appropriate virtual machines. The ES-DE Algorithm incorporates the Levy Strategy for global optimization of physical machines, followed by local search optimization using the Differential Evolution Algorithm, an enhancement of the Genetic Algorithm.
